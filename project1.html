                    <p>First, I went onto TikTok to see what shoppers had to say about their online shopping experiences at Zara. <br> <br> I chose to conduct user research on TikTok as they have a large fashion community on the app, and TikTok is a platform where people share their opinions about everything and anything. <br> <br> Many people were not happy with the website, saying that it made it hard for them to browse for clothes they wanted, ultimately driving them away from the site. </p>

                    <p>I used Miro to organize my ideas and clearly see the problems and their possible solutions. A few of these problems were ones that I have personally had with the website as a shopper, and other ones were gathered from TikTok or a click-through of the website.</p>

                <h3>Home Screen Navigation</h3>
                <br>
                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> Currently, the navigation bar highlights a link according to the background image. I find that 1. the bolding of the font is barely noticable, and 2. there doesn't really seem to be a point of this choice. </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> Highlighting the link based on what the user is hovering over is more user-friendly. Furthermore, since the bolding of the text is not very noticable, I added a sleek underline to enhance the highlight. </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> The videos on the home page are distracting, there is constantly new content being shown, some which make the text hard to read. One example taken from the website is shown below. The black font is hard to read on top of the shadows casted by the clothing. </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> This video taken from the website is a much better example of what kind of backgrounds work for the website. The sea is relatively monotone, which contrasts with the white text, making it more visible and easy to read. </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> One issue with the website was in the navigation menu. The bar at the top cuts off the some categories. A user can scroll to the other categories by clicking on the last visible link (Massimo Dutti), but would be unable to scroll back and make the first categories visible again (Woman, Man). <br> <br> Furthermore, the menu is quite small, hiding a lot of the links in the hamburger navigation. </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> I designed a new navigation menu for the website using Figma. <br> <br> The new design allows for users to see more of the categories at once and solves the issue with the navigation bar. </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> There isn't a sorting feature on the website where shoppers can sort the merchandise by price. </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p> I added two buttons to the existing price-sorting filters to users can choose to sort or filter the items.</p>

                    <p>This was the first redesign I've ever done so it's safe to say that I learned a lot! This was my first time using Miro and it's super useful for brainstorming ideas and organizing all of them in one place. I also learned that TikTok is a great place to do market research for fashion e-commerce with the large presence of the fashion community. This was also a great oppurtunity to learn more about what makes for a great user experience, and I'm glad I pursued this project :)</p>
